# Bank Management System

This project provides the SQL database implementation for a Bank Management System, designed to manage and streamline various banking operations. The script contains the database schema, including table definitions, relationships, and constraints, as well as sample queries for common operations.

## Features

- Customer Management: Tables for storing customer details like name, address, and contact information.
- Account Management: Support for different account types (e.g., savings, current), with fields for balance tracking.
- Transaction Management: Structures to log deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- Branch Details: Integration of branch-specific data for localized banking operations.
- Security Features: Constraints to ensure data integrity, including primary keys, foreign keys, and other validations.

## Prerequisites

- Database Management System: Ensure you have a relational database system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any SQL-compatible DBMS installed.
- SQL Client: A tool for executing SQL scripts, such as MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or a terminal with DBMS access.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or Download the Repository: Obtain the SQL script file (`Bank Management System.sql`).
2. Create a Database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE bank_management;
   ```
3. Import the Script: Use the following command or your SQL client to execute the script:
   ```sql
   USE bank_management;
   SOURCE /path/to/Bank Management System.sql;
   ```
4. Verify the Installation:
   - Check that all tables are created successfully.
   - Run a sample query to ensure proper functioning.

## Tables Included

- Customers: Stores customer-related information.
- Accounts: Details of accounts held by customers.
- Transactions: Logs of all banking transactions.
- Branches: Details of branch offices.

## Usage

- Modify or extend the schema as needed to adapt the system for specific banking requirements.
- Use predefined queries or write your own to interact with the database for operations like:
  - Viewing customer data.
  - Performing account balance checks.
  - Recording deposits or withdrawals.
